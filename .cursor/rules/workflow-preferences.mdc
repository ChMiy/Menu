# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- If a Roadmap file exists - Do not delete items, just put a green ticker emoji in front on the ones that are completed, do that after completing a task.~
- After marking an item as done in the roadmap keep going to the next one unless you've completed a full section, if so stop and ask me what to do
- Keep Folders clean and organized, delete anything that does not serve a purpose - BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN DELETING AND 100% sure before deleting anything
- Never use inline css, always create styles.css file and do the styling there
- After using terminal verify if the operation you made had the desired effect before doing anything else
