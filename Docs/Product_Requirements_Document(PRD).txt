4. 🎨 Visual Design — Styling & Identity
Color Palette
Element	Color	Hex
Primary background	Deep blue	#0D1B2A
Accent (highlight)	Elegant gold	#D4AF37
Neutral background	Soft beige/crème	#F5F5DC
Text (on dark bg)	Light crème/gold	#F7F1E1
•	Dark navy blue should dominate background screens.
•	Gold should be used for text highlights, borders, and decorative accents.
•	Beige/crème may be used for minimal background elements or logo contrast.
Typography
•	Main font: EngraversGothic BT (The font EngraversGothic BT must be fully embedded via web font (e.g. @font-face) so that it is loaded directly from the site, requiring no installation on the tablets. The font files (.woff, .woff2) must be included in the /assets/fonts/ folder and referenced in CSS.)
•	Fallbacks: Georgia, serif
•	All headings, menu labels, and language buttons should use this font.
________________________________________
5. 🖼️ Language Selection Page (index.html)
•	Full-screen layout, centered both vertically and horizontally.
•	Five large language buttons with flag icons and language names (PT, EN, FR, ES, DE).
•	Button styling:
o	Background: transparent
o	Border: 2px solid #D4AF37 (gold)
o	Text: uppercase, bold, EngraversGothic BT, gold
o	Hover: slight glow or soft inner shadow effect
•	Background: solid deep blue.
•	Logo (if provided): centered above the buttons.
•	The restaurant logo must be loaded from /assets/logo.png and referenced in the HTML using a standard <img> tag with responsive dimensions. The logo file can be replaced directly by uploading a new image to that path. No changes to HTML or CSS should be required to update the logo. Recommended dimensions and format should be documented in the project guide (e.g., PNG, 500x500px, transparent background).
•	Since tablets do not support hover effects, animations must be touch-friendly and visually noticeable. Recommended: fade-ins, slow zooms on tap, or slight scale/tilt animations on press. All effects must preserve the page’s luxury aesthetic (no bounce or cartoonish easing).

6. 🍽️ Menu Type Selection Page (select-menu.html)
After selecting the language, user is redirected to a refined vertical split screen with:
•	Left side:
o	Background image representing the Food Menu
o	Overlay title: “Menu” in selected language
o	Short subtitle like “Discover our dishes”
o	Entire left panel is a button
•	Right side:
o	Background image representing the Wine Menu
o	Overlay title: “Wine List” in selected language
o	Subtitle: “Explore our cellar”
o	Entire right panel is a button
•	•  Image configuration: Background images for each panel (Menu and Wine Menu) must be defined in the CSS with separate classes and must be easily replaceable by updating the image file in /assets/.
•	•  A dedicated admin guide must be provided explaining:
o	How to change the images (file names, format, recommended resolution)
o	How to preview the page locally before pushing to GitHub
Animations: All hover effects must be replaced or accompanied by tap-triggered or auto-play animations, such as:
•	Slow zoom-in effect on panel background images
•	Smooth slide-in text on page load
•	Gold divider line animating in with a fade or grow effect
All animations must remain slow, refined, and elegant.
Styling specifics:
•	Each panel = 50% width
•	Divided with thin gold vertical line
•	Text overlays use EngraversGothic BT in uppercase, with gold font color
•	On hover or touch: subtle fade animation or shadow
Images:
•	Should be muted, classy, slightly desaturated
•	Examples: fine dish close-up, elegant wine glass on linen
