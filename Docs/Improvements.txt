- [x] Implement sequential preloading strategy (page 1, then 2, then 3, etc.)
- [x] Convert images to WebP format with JPEG fallback
- [x] Implement image size optimization for tablet resolutions (User will handle manually)

✅ SEQUENTIAL PRELOADING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED:
   → Implemented sequential preloading: loads page 1 first, then page 2, then page 3, etc.
   → True sequential processing - each image waits for previous to complete
   → Eliminated artificial 200ms delays for cached images (now instant)
   → Maintains natural throttling for network requests
   → Prioritizes earlier pages that users will see first
   → No visual loading states - pure technical optimization only
   → Result: Significantly faster loading, especially for cached content

✅ WEBP FALLBACK SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED:

   → Tries WebP first (30-35% smaller files), falls back to JPEG if unavailable
   → Works with accidental JPEG uploads - never breaks the website
   → Updated JavaScript image loading with intelligent fallback detection
   → Updated service worker to cache both WebP and JPEG formats
   → Updated sequential preloading to support both formats
   → No conversion scripts needed - upload WebP preferred, JPEG as backup
   → Result: Optimized performance for modern browsers, full compatibility for all cases

6. AUTOMATED CONTENT MANAGEMENT
Problem: Manual updates require code changes
Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH
Solutions:

   → Automatic detection of new content triggers cache invalidation
   → Service worker version tracking for cache invalidation on code changes
   → Silent automatic operation (no notifications or manual controls)
   → Tablet-optimized (no keyboard shortcuts required)
   → Graceful fallback to estimated counts with safety timeouts
   → Console logging for debugging and monitoring
   → Zero-code content updates - upload images and system adapts automatically
   → Result: Restaurant staff can add new menu pages without any code changes

✅ CONTENT HASH DETECTION IMPLEMENTED (v21):
   → Smart hash generation from first 3 images using HTTP headers (Last-Modified, Content-Length, ETag)
   → Automatic detection of replaced content (same file names, different content)
   → Silent cache invalidation when content changes detected
   → Lightweight HEAD requests for hash generation (no full image download)
   → Fallback to both WebP and JPEG formats for hash comparison
   → Perfect integration with existing detection and caching systems
   → Solves cache invalidation for replaced images (not just new images)
   → Result: Upload new WebP files with same names - system detects and refreshes automatically


7. PATH MANAGEMENT STANDARDIZATION
Problem: Inconsistent path handling across JavaScript files
Priority: MEDIUM
Solutions:
- [x] Create centralized path management utility
- [x] Standardize base path detection logic
- [x] Simplify GitHub Pages vs localhost detection
- [x] Remove redundant path calculation code

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ CRITICAL FIX - Double /pages/ Path Resolution Issue:
   → Root Cause: select-menu.html was in /pages/ directory, causing relative path resolution errors
   → Solution: Created select-menu-fixed.html with conditional path logic:
      - Localhost: Use relative paths (menu/menu-pt.html) since already in /pages/
      - GitHub Pages: Use absolute paths (/Menu/pages/menu/menu-pt.html)
   → Result: Fixed 404 errors from /pages/pages/menu/menu-pt.html

✅ CRITICAL FIX - Multiple Conflicting isLocalhost() Functions:
   → Root Cause: navigation.js had THREE different isLocalhost() functions causing conflicts
   → Solution: Consolidated into single function at top of file with global GLOBAL_BASE_PATH variable
   → Result: Eliminated function conflicts and inconsistent localhost detection

✅ SERVICE WORKER CACHE BUSTING:
   → Updated cache versions from v12-force-refresh to v14-path-fixed
   → Added new select-menu-fixed.html to cache manifest
   → Forced complete cache refresh to eliminate cached incorrect paths

✅ NAVIGATION PATH FIXES:
   → Updated index.html to navigate to select-menu-fixed.html
   → Fixed navigation.js to use correct paths for back navigation
   → Updated all navigation points to use centralized path logic

================================================================

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF YOUR OBSERVATIONS:

1. "IMAGES NOT CACHING PROPERLY - VISIBLE LOADING ON NAVIGATION"
✅ CONFIRMED - Root cause identified:
   → Service worker caches incorrect paths (menu-en.jpg vs menu/en/menu_en-1.jpg)
   → Every navigation triggers network request instead of cache hit
   → Critical fix needed in service-worker.js IMAGE_ASSETS array

2. "BETTER MEDIA LOADING FOR FASTER PERFORMANCE WITHOUT QUALITY LOSS"
✅ MULTIPLE OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
   → Current: Direct JPEG loading with object-fit: fill
   → Improvements: WebP conversion, progressive loading, preloading
   → Size optimization: Currently no compression strategy implemented
   → Consider responsive images for different tablet resolutions

3. "APP SHOULD ADAPT TO NEW UPLOADED IMAGES AUTOMATICALLY"
✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED BUT INEFFICIENT:
   → Current: detectTotalPages() function tests image existence one-by-one
   → Issue: Relies on 404 errors to determine page count
   → Better: Dynamic folder scanning with proper cache invalidation
   → Recommendation: Service worker should dynamically discover assets
