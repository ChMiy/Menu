GitHub Pages Deployment Guide
Project: Restaurant Menu Website
________________________________________

This guide explains how to deploy the Restaurant Menu website to GitHub Pages using the GitHub web interface.

1. Create a GitHub Repository
   - Go to github.com and sign in to your account
   - Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name it "restaurant-menu" (or your preferred name)
   - Make it Public (GitHub Pages requires public repos for free accounts)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Upload Files
   - In your new empty repository, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop all project files or use the file picker
   - Important: Maintain the exact folder structure:
     /
     ├── index.html
     ├── manifest.json
     ├── service-worker.js
     ├── assets/
     ├── js/
     └── pages/

3. Enable GitHub Pages
   - Go to repository "Settings" (tab with gear icon)
   - Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch
   - Select "/ (root)" as the folder
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait a few minutes for deployment

4. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)
   - Still in "GitHub Pages" settings
   - Under "Custom domain", enter your domain
   - Click "Save"
   - Add the required DNS records at your domain registrar
   - Wait for HTTPS certificate to be issued (may take up to 24 hours)

5. Verify Deployment
   - GitHub will provide a URL like: https://username.github.io/repository-name
   - Visit the URL and verify:
     • All pages load correctly
     • Fonts are working
     • Images display properly
     • PWA installs correctly
     • Offline functionality works

6. Updating Content
   To update menu images or other content:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to the relevant folder (e.g., /assets/images/menu/)
   - Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop new images
   - Add a commit message describing the update
   - Click "Commit changes"
   - Wait a few minutes for changes to deploy

7. Important Notes
   - The site URL will be public but not listed anywhere
   - Updates may take a few minutes to appear due to caching
   - Keep image sizes optimized for faster loading
   - Regularly test PWA functionality after updates
   - Back up menu images before replacing them

8. Troubleshooting
   If the site doesn't work after deployment:
   - Check if all files uploaded successfully
   - Verify the repository is public
   - Ensure index.html is in the root directory
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Clear browser cache and service worker
   - Wait 10-15 minutes for full deployment
